Url for fetching the menu json is below

( It may not work as I don't know what's the limit for api call or when it will get deleted )

https://jsonkeeper.com/b/8L23

If the app is not fetching the data, then create a new url at https://jsonkeeper.com/
with the [ menu.json file ]

then edit in DinDinApi at line no 8 -> [ @get:GET("b/8L23") ]
